# Artifact 1: L0 — The Ontological Substrate of Risk
## What Must Be True for Risk to Exist at All
**February 2026**

---

## 1. The Core Definition

**Risk exists wherever an identity-preserving dynamical system with branching future trajectories is embedded in a perturbable field such that some trajectories contract the system's reachable state space.**

Unpacked:

- **Identity-preserving dynamical system.** Something persists through time and change while remaining recognizably itself. This is not a metaphysical claim about essence — it is a continuity condition. The system has a reference frame against which "contraction" and "expansion" can be evaluated. Without this, there is no subject of risk; change happens, but nothing is *at risk*.

- **Branching future trajectories.** The system's evolution is not fully determined. From any present state, multiple future states are reachable. This is the structural precondition for uncertainty. A system on a single deterministic path faces no risk — its future is fixed, for better or worse.

- **Embedded in a perturbable field.** The system does not evolve in isolation. It is coupled to an environment (or to its own internal dynamics) in ways that can alter its trajectory. Perturbation can be external (a shock, a change in conditions) or internal (instability, feedback failure, structural contradiction). What matters is that the system's path through state space is not self-contained.

- **Some trajectories contract the reachable state space.** Among the possible futures, some lead to states from which fewer further futures are reachable. The system's horizon of possibility narrows. This is what makes risk *risk* rather than mere change — not all change is contraction, but risk specifically concerns the reduction of what remains possible.

## 2. Minimal Necessary Conditions

L0 rests on four conditions. Each is necessary — removing any one eliminates risk entirely.

### Condition 1: Identity Boundary

There must be a distinction between "the system" and "not the system" that persists through time.

**Why it's necessary:** Without an identity boundary, contraction cannot be evaluated. If there is no continuity condition, then a state space that shrinks is indistinguishable from one system ending and another beginning. Risk requires a *subject* — something for which futures are being lost.

**What it is not:** Identity does not require consciousness, agency, or fixed boundaries. A river has an identity boundary (its watershed, its channel, its flow patterns) even though every molecule of water is replaced over time. Identity here means: a reference frame stable enough to make "this system's reachable futures contracted" a meaningful statement.

**The functional test:** Can you coherently say "this system has fewer reachable futures than it did before"? If yes, there is sufficient identity continuity. If the question is incoherent for the thing in question, it is not a risk-bearing system at this level of description.

### Condition 2: State Space

The system must occupy a space of possible states, where states are distinguishable configurations the system can be in.

**Why it's necessary:** Without a state space, there are no trajectories, no branching, no contraction. Risk presupposes a landscape of possibility against which movement — and specifically narrowing — can be defined.

**What it is not:** The state space need not be quantified or fully known. It must simply exist as a structural feature of the system — the system *could be* in configurations other than the one it currently occupies.

### Condition 3: Branching Future Trajectories

From any present state, the system's evolution must admit multiple possible futures. The path forward is not singular.

**Why it's necessary:** A system whose trajectory is fully determined has a fate, not a risk. Deterministic systems can be destroyed, but their destruction is not uncertain — it is either on the trajectory or not. Risk requires that the system's future is open: that which path is taken is not yet settled.

**What it is not:** Branching does not require randomness in the quantum or stochastic sense. It requires underdetermination — the system's future depends on conditions not fully specified by its present state. This can arise from environmental coupling, internal complexity, chaotic sensitivity, or incomplete information. The source of branching matters less than its structural presence.

### Condition 4: Perturbability

The system must be coupled to dynamics (external or internal) capable of influencing which trajectory is realized.

**Why it's necessary:** A system with branching futures but no mechanism by which one branch is favored over another is in a state of pure abstract possibility, not risk. Risk requires that something *could push* the system toward state-space contraction. Perturbability is what connects the abstract possibility of contraction to the concrete possibility of it happening.

**What it is not:** Perturbation does not require an external agent or a discrete "event." It can be continuous (environmental drift), internal (accumulating incoherence), or structural (dependencies that transmit instability). What matters is coupling — the system's trajectory is not insulated from influence.

## 3. Explicit Exclusions

L0 must exclude configurations that do not constitute risk, even if colloquial language might describe them that way.

### A static object in a vacuum is not at risk.
It has no branching futures and no perturbability. It will remain as it is. (If we add perturbability — say, a meteor could hit it — then it becomes risk-bearing. The risk is introduced by the coupling, not by the object.)

### A system that changes but has no identity boundary is not at risk.
A gas diffusing in an open space is changing state continuously, but if we define no boundary around it, there is no coherent subject for which contraction can be assessed. The gas does not "lose futures" — it simply evolves. (If we bound it — define a volume, a pressure, a function it serves — we have introduced an identity, and now risk exists relative to that reference frame.)

### A fully determined system is not at risk in the L0 sense.
If a system's trajectory is singular and known — no branching, no perturbation — its future is certain. It may be a *bad* future, but it is not a risky one. Risk requires openness. (In practice, fully determined systems are rare to nonexistent. But the exclusion matters conceptually: certainty of destruction is tragedy, not risk.)

### Change that does not contract state space is not risk.
A system can be perturbed, its trajectory altered, its state changed — and still retain or expand its reachable future states. This is adaptation, evolution, or transformation, but it is not risk-as-such. Risk specifically concerns the narrowing of what remains possible. Expansion of possibility under perturbation is the structural opposite of risk — it is what we might later (at L3) call regeneration or antifragility, but at L0 we simply note that it is not contraction.

## 4. Three Wrong Ontologies (And Why They Fail)

Each of the following is a widely used definition of risk. Each captures something real but fails as a foundational ontology because it presupposes structure that L0 must supply.

### Wrong Ontology 1: Risk = Probability × Impact

This is the actuarial and enterprise risk management default. It treats risk as a scalar — a number produced by multiplying the likelihood of an event by the magnitude of its consequences.

**Where it fails:**

It presupposes a defined event, a bounded consequence, and a metric for severity — all of which require the identity boundary, state space, and perturbability conditions to already be in place. Probability × impact is a *calculation performed within* a risk-bearing configuration, not a definition of what makes that configuration risk-bearing.

More critically, it treats risk as a quantity. Two risks that produce the same product (low probability × high impact, or high probability × low impact) are treated as equivalent. But from the L0 perspective, these represent structurally different topologies — a system with many branching futures that mostly preserve state space but occasionally catastrophically contract it is a fundamentally different configuration from a system with few branches that mostly contract by small amounts. Scalar multiplication destroys this structural information.

### Wrong Ontology 2: Risk = Volatility

This is the financial markets default (variance, standard deviation, VaR, beta). It treats risk as dispersion of outcomes around an expected value.

**Where it fails:**

Volatility can exist without state-space contraction. A system that oscillates widely but always returns to — or expands — its reachable state manifold is volatile but not, at L0, at risk. Volatility measures the *amplitude* of trajectory variation, not its *direction* relative to the state manifold boundary.

Conversely, state-space contraction can occur without volatility. A system that smoothly and quietly loses reachable futures — through slow dependency accumulation, gradual structural degradation, or creeping loss of redundancy — registers low volatility but high risk in the L0 sense. The system is not fluctuating; it is narrowing.

Volatility is a statistical shadow of perturbability (Condition 4), but it ignores Conditions 1–3 entirely. It measures agitation without asking: agitation *of what*, in *what space*, toward *what contraction*?

### Wrong Ontology 3: Risk = Exposure to Loss

This is the insurance and regulatory default. It treats risk as the relationship between a valued thing and a possible adverse event that could damage or destroy it.

**Where it fails:**

"Loss" presupposes that the thing at risk has already been reified as a valued asset, that "adverse" has been defined relative to some preference ordering, and that the event is discrete and identifiable. All of these are interpretive layers built on top of L0, not part of it.

The deeper problem is that "exposure to loss" treats risk as a binary relationship between an asset and a hazard — something you *have* that something else could *take*. This frames risk as a property of objects in proximity to threats. But at L0, risk is a property of *the topology of the system's evolution* — it arises from the structure of branching, coupling, and contraction, not from the proximity of a valued thing to a damaging event.

This wrong ontology is the one most likely to produce the design errors the alignment check warns against: subscores that measure attributes of assets rather than dynamics of relational patterns.

## 5. What L0 Does and Does Not Provide

### L0 provides:

- **A domain-general substrate.** The same four conditions apply to forests, bridges, DAOs, organisms, and token networks. No domain-specific concepts are required.
- **Structural exclusions.** A clear basis for saying "this is not a risk-bearing configuration" — which is essential for preventing the word "risk" from becoming a catch-all that means everything and therefore nothing.
- **A foundation that does not depend on what is built on it.** L0 contains no references to capital, value, stewardship, economics, agents, assets, or hazards. These all enter at higher layers as interpretive structures.

### L0 does not provide:

- **Measurement.** L0 says *what must be true* for risk to exist; it does not say *how to measure* risk. That is L1's task — converting the structural conditions into geometric descriptions (manifold contraction, invariants, resilience operators) that can, in principle, be quantified.
- **Valuation.** L0 is ethically and economically neutral. It says that a virus, a glacier, and a corporation are all risk-bearing systems in the same structural sense. It does not say which matters more, what "loss" means in normative terms, or what anyone should do about it. Normative content enters at L2 and above.
- **Operational categories.** L0 does not decompose risk into probability, impact, and containment. That decomposition is an L2 operation — the projection of L1 geometry into operational dimensions. L0 is the ground from which that projection will eventually be derived, but it does not contain the projection itself.

## 6. The Transition to L1

L0 establishes *that* risk exists in certain configurations. L1 must establish *how* risk behaves within those configurations — its geometry, dynamics, and measurable invariants.

The key question L1 must answer: **Given a system that satisfies the four L0 conditions, what determines whether its state space contracts slowly or catastrophically, elastically or irreversibly, locally or globally?**

This is the question of topology — not "is there risk?" but "what shape is the risk?" — and it is where the morphological invariants (redundancy, connectivity, feedback structure, regeneration rate, dependency concentration) will be formally introduced.

L0 tells us the game board exists. L1 tells us what the terrain looks like.
